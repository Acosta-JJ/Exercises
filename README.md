# Exercises by Jose Javier Acosta Santana
In this repository I automated every task, so the only thing needed to see the results of the exercises is execute the .py files.
## SQL exercises
In the SQL exercise I replicate the SQL Database using sqlite3 which is a module for python. When the file sql.py is executed the databases deploy automatically in a .db file, after that the querys which solves the exercises are performed and the result are retrieved in the console.

## Programing exercises
On the Programing exercises I use functional programming, because for easy coditions in data manipulation is optimal and also the code is more clear. The data needed for the exercises is shown in the console as is requested in the exercise 6.

## Test
For testing I used unittest which is a module of python to automate testing task. I make a simple JSON file and test every function in programing exercises.
To use this automated test tool it is mandatory to execute the test file like this:
```python3 -m unittest test```
